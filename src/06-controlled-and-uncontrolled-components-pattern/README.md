### Controlled Components

- Controlled components are components where React controls the state (via State Management) of the component.
- We make use of the `useState` hook provided by React to manage a controlled component's state.
- To update the state of the component you typically make use of the `setState` handler provided by React.

### Uncontrolled Componenets

- Uncontrolled components are the components where data is handled by DOM itself rather than React.
- Uncontrolled components maintain their own state internally and React does not control the state.
- We make use of the `useRef` hook provided by React to manage uncontrolled components.
